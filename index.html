<h2>A little about me</h2>
<p>&nbsp;I was born and raised in Florida. I love theme parks, space exploration, and making music. I play trumpet for the BYU marching band, I like to spend my free time doing anything sports related or flying my drone for photography, and I am a Computer Science Major in my sophmore year. </p>

<h2>My Projects</h2>
	<li>For my <u>Eagle Scout Service Project</u> I interviewed local military veterans and conducted interviews with them about their time in the service and how it affected their lives. Then I assembled a team to transcribe these interviews and return an audio and written copy of the interview to each veteran for their family to keep. A copy of each was also given to a local American Legion Veterans Post.</li>
	<li>In my senior year of high school I <u>built a website for my high school marching band</u>. Hoping to impress our new director this site included embedded videos of the band performing, guides for students and parents to check grades and reminders, and a page with contact information for the band director and the band social media pages. Unfortunately the site never went public because the band's new director told me that I cared too much and that it wouldn't be worth the money to host the site. That director then left the school and band program less than a year after joining us.</li>
	<li>This past year, I began working on a personal project based on something I love, theme parks. <u>Using python I am building a program that can get the current wait times for Walt Disney World attractions and organize them</u>. I plan to add functionalities such as creating a lists of rides based on wait times and walking distances or experience type to maximize efficiency. My end goal is to develop this program into something that I can connect to a website so that others can utilize this tool.</li>

	<h2>Work Experience</h2>
	<li>From April to August of 2020, I worked front end at a local Walgreens. Given that I was the youngest employee there and was good with computers, I was left to resolve many customer issues with the photography department kiosks.</li>
	<li>From June to August 2021, I worked as a late-night custodian on BYU campus at the Smith Fliedhouse. There was nothing too particularly interesting about this job, other than the spooky and inexplicable noises me and my coworkers would hear at night.</li>
